# Model Kayak

In this project (c. 9/20 - 10/20), I used computer-aided design software, Autodesk Inventor, to model a kayak in three-dimensions. The objective of this project was to improve my modeling ability of complex, curved surfaces. This kayak is modeled after the "Braaap 69" kayak described in Kayak.docx.
