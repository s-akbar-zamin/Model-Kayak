# Model Kayak

In this project (c. 9/20 - 10/20), I used computer-aided design software, Autodesk Inventor, to model a kayak in three-dimensions. The objective of this project was to improve my modeling ability of complex, curved surfaces. This kayak is modeled after the "Braaap 69" kayak described in PDF. Dimensions were measured roughly in this PDF.

This describes a sequence of steps used to generate the object. I primarily used form modeling to generate this object.

# To do

On revisiting this project, I plan to hollow out the center for seating in the model. I could refine the shape of the kayak to change stability, speed, and other parameters. 

# Possible Applications

This model could be used to create cross-sectional molds of the kayak at different points along the long axis. Combining fiberglass with resin between these cross-sectional planes could be an enjoyable build-your-own-kayak project. Fiberglass and resin has great tensile strength and is resistant to water. It is even used to construct some homebuilt aircraft!
